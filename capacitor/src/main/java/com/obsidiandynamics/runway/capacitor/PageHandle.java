/**
 *  A single-use fa√ßade for accessing objects retained in a {@link Capacitor}. <p>
 *  
 *  Once a handle is obtained through {@link Capacitor#acquire(Object)}, a lock must be acquired
 *  before the encapsulated object can be accessed. Depending on whether the object will be read
 *  from or written to, a {@link LockMode#SHARED} or a {@link LockMode#EXCLUSIVE} lock mode
 *  must first be negotiated with a call to {@link #lock(LockMode)}. The negotiation
 *  of a lock mode is a blocking action. Once negotiated, the object may be retrieved by calling
 *  {@link PageHandle#value()}. <p>
 *  
 *  A {@link PageHandle} instance is short-lived, and valid only for the duration of the
 *  acquisition scope. Closing a handle disposes it and indicates to the capacitor that the
 *  in-memory page is relieved of one acquirer (decrementing its use count). Once closed, a
 *  handle instance cannot be reused. <p>
 *  
 *  The {@link PageHandle} class implements the {@link AutoCloseable} interface, making it suited
 *  for use from within a try-with-resources statement. In fact, this is the recommended pattern
 *  for interacting with objects, as it guarantees that a negotiated lock is released correctly
 *  and the in-memory page is relinquished when control leaves the handle's scope. Otherwise,
 *  you must ensure that a page handle is closed (by calling {@link #close()}) when you are
 *  done with the object. <p>
 *  
 *  Additionally, a handle offers convenience methods for replacing the value of an in-memory
 *  object and for forcibly reloading the object from the storage tier. In order to use the
 *  {@link #reload()} and {@link #replace(Object)} methods, the caller must first negotiate
 *  an exclusive lock over the acquired object.
 *
 *  @param <I> ID type.
 *  @param <J> Object type.
